"""
Data was preprocessed in the following ways:
    - resize to im_shape;
    - equalize histogram (skimage.exposure.equalize_hist);
    - normalize by data set mean and std.
Resulting shape should be (n_samples, img_width, img_height, 1).
It may be more convenient to store preprocessed data for faster loading.
Dataframe should contain paths to images and masks as two columns (relative to `path`).
